I've grown up as a musician - I have somewhere around a decade of classical piano lessons, and I've loved computer music ever since I was around 10 years old.  In the digital audio world, musicians often use programs called "samplers" - these programs play back real instruments in a digital enviornment, and allow for digital orchestration an production.
